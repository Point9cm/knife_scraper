	- class KnifeFormatter needs to have units functionality (.su comand to set units from mks to inches)
	- each field parsed by query_bhq_knife should receive attributes related to how they are represented in
		a. KnifeFormatter
		b. sqlite3 database
	 The parsed item should retain original text values for formatting
	 Knives should report in cm (not meters) if in mks
	- if we get a page url starting with "cat" parse the "meta" tag with name="keywords" then perform a search on keywords
		a. the content field of meta name="keywords" contains a comma delimited string of all the knives in the bhq category. After reading in this string:
			i. split on ","
			i. replace("&quote","") to remove quotes
		b. alternatively it appears the last string in a content substring is the item model number - just append this to the original query to get to a unique page result ( seems to work on ddg fine)
		c. not necessary to expand page results because ALL category results are present in the "keywords" meta tag ( all the results displayed in a browser are there from Javascript ).
	- get Database feature working - inconclusive searchs can be time consuming (about 1 second / search - a bad search can mean 6 seconds of waiting where a database + fuzzy search is much faster ).
